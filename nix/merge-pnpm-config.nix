{ pkgs }:

# Python script that mirrors `pnpm.overrides` and `pnpm.patchedDependencies`
# from package.json into pnpm-workspace.yaml. Required because pnpm 11's
# strict frozen-install reads workspace-scoped config from
# pnpm-workspace.yaml, while this project still keeps the truth in
# package.json#pnpm. The synthesised file is consumed inside the Nix
# sandbox only; the repo source is untouched.
#
# It also sets `trustLockfile: true`: pnpm 11's default supply-chain pass
# ("Verifying lockfile against supply-chain policies") re-validates every
# entry against the registry, which needs network access. The deps are
# pre-fetched by fetchPnpmDeps and installed with `--offline`, so we trust
# the already-frozen lockfile and skip that online pass inside the sandbox.
